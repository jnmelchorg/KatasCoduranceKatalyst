# Katas from Codurance Katalyst


[Software Crafters North](https://www.meetup.com/software-crafters-north/), supported by employees from [Codurance](https://www.codurance.com/) in Manchester, has been running a series of continuous events. These events provide the opportunity for aspiring software engineers of any level of proficiency to come and learn the best practices in the world of software development. They have created a series of training problems or katas, where trainees like me can learn and apply the best practices in software development. This repository contains my solutions to those katas. The katas can be found in [katalys](https://www.codurance.com/katalyst).
